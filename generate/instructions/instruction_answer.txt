Q: For $i=\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$ Answer Choices: (A)$-1+12 i$ (B)$-1-6 i$ (C)$15+12 i$ (D)$15-6 i$
A: Correct Index: 0; Explanation: To find the sum of $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$, you simply add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. Real parts: $7+(-8)=-1$, Imaginary parts: $3i+9i=12i$. So, the sum is $-1+12i$. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A)$-1+12i$, so the correct index is 0.
