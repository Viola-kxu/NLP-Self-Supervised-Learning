1. Create a set of answer options for the question; if the given answer options are already correct, you can keep them as they are.
2. Then conclude your response by indicating the correct option using an index: respond with 0 if the answer is (A); respond with 1 if the asnwer is (B); and so on, your answer choices response must be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Format your must be in the following format: "New options: [your options]; \n Correct Index: [index]; Explanation: [your detailed reasoning]".

Q: For $i=\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$ Answer Choices: (A)$-1+12 i$ (B)$-1-6 i$ (C)$15+12 i$ (D)$15-6 i$
A: New options: (A)$-1+12 i$ (B)$-1-6 i$ (C)$15+12 i$ (D)$15-6 i$; Correct Index: 0;
Explanation: To find the sum of $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$, you simply add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. Real parts: $7+(-8)=-1$, Imaginary parts: $3i+9i=12i$. So, the sum is $-1+12i$. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A)$-1+12i$, so the correct index is 0.
