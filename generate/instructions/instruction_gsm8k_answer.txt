#Given question#:
Q: For $i=\sqrt{-1}$, what is the sum $(7+3 i)+(-8+9 i) ?$
A: To find the sum of $(7+3i) + (-8+9i)$, you simply add the real parts together and the imaginary parts together. Real parts: $7+(-8)=-1$, Imaginary parts: $3i+9i=12i$. So, the sum is $-1+12i$. Therefore, the correct answer choice is -1 + 12i. \n### -1+12i
